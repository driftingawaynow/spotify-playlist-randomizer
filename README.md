# spotify-playlist-randomizer

This is a webapp that creates randomized spotify playlists.
It's currently in development mode, so if you want access I have to manually add you.

Built mainly using Javascript and React. It interacts with the Spotify API to pull song recommendations and build
custom and chaotic playlists.
