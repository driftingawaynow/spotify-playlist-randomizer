# spotify-playlist-randomizer

This is a webapp that creates randomized spotify playlists.
It's currently in development mode, so if you want access I have to manually add you.
Spotify does not allow me to open this up to everyone as it is a hobby project!

Built mainly using Javascript and React. It interacts with the Spotify API to pull song recommendations and build
custom and chaotic playlists. 

GENRE MODE:
Genre mode selects a random decade and a random genre from the Spotify API. If you like the selection chosen, you can then generate your playlist,
otherwise you can reroll.

CHAOS MODE:
Chaos mode takes random parameters out of your top artists and feeds them into the spotify recommendations API. It also adds in other random noise to each
search such as Popularity, Tempo (BPM), and Time Signature. When run over a large amount of iterations, you end up pretty far from where you started, making quite a hectic playlist!
